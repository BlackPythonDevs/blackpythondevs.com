## Coffee and Code

Join us every Friday for a cup of coffee and a chance to code with fellow Python enthusiasts. Our community is open to all levels of experience, from beginners to experts.

We’ll be discussing the latest trends in Python development, sharing tips and tricks, and working on projects together. Whether you’re looking to learn something new or just want to hang out with like-minded people, this is the perfect opportunity to do so. We look forward to seeing you there!
