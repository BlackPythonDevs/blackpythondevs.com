We're excited to have [Typefully](https://typefully.com) sponsoring Black Python Devs.

Originally designed to help Twitter (now X) users schedule tweets, create threads and learn more about their engagement with analytics, Typefully has expanded that offering to help individuals and teams across a wider range of services including, Mastodon, Bluesky, and LinkedIn. After reaching out to the company, we were delighted to learn how they were using Python in their offering.

We are happy to announce that Typefully has provided us with the ability to schedule posts and monitor the engagement across all of our social platforms.

The savings that Typefully is offering us gives us the ability to sponsor another event in our current operating budget which means more developers around the world will have access to more local Python community events.

A massive thanks to Typefully for their contribution to Black Python Devs and the greater Python Community.
