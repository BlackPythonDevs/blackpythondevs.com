title: O'Reilly Media Partners with Black Python Devs
---

We are excited to announce a new partnership with O'Reilly Media!

You can [get a 30-day free trial of O'Reilly's Learning Platform](https://oreillymedia.pxf.io/c/5713155/2126973/15173). If you continue past your trial, a portion of your subscription will go to Black Python Devs.

## A multi-faceted partnership

A common question from professionals is how to continue learning and what resources are trusted by other Python professionals.

Our partnership with O'Reilly is one that will see us providing O'Reilly content to communities of Black Pythonistas through our [Book Club](https://blackpythondevs.com/bookclub) and [Local Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/black-python-devs).

We're incredibly excited for this opportunity and we hope that folks considering the O'Reilly Learning Platform will consider using [our affiliate link](https://oreillymedia.pxf.io/c/5713155/2126973/15173) to continue their learning and contribute to Black Python Devs.
