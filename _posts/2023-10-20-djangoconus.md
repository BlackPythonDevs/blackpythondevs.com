In Durham, North Carolina, approximately 300 Django developers gathered from all over the world for [DjangoCon US](https://2023.djangocon.us/). This event showcased the knowledge of the community and celebrated its cultural diversity and the diversity of its hosting city. The event was located at the Marriot Convention Center, in the heart of the city. There were many resturants and smaller attractions.

## Location Diversity Index: Good

The Location Diversity Index is a check against events in the United States for cultural diversity. Durham, North Carolina served as a wonderful backdrop for this conference. Known for its vibrant culture and diverse community, it was an excellent choice for a smaller Python conference, measuring at **Good** with the primary demographic only making up 56% of the population. This reflects the inclusive spirit of Python conferences, welcoming individuals from all walks of life.

## Diversity at a Glance

While diversity at the conference was notable, the conference appeared to have less than 10% Black attendees. That said the presence of black attendees did feel greater than conferences significantly larger.

Even though there is room for improvement, the conference made strides in addressing the racial diversity of the conference. Conversations about how to improve this have already started.

## Events:

### DjangoGirls Durham

DjangoCon hosted a [DjangoGirls](https://djangogirls.org/en/events/) event in in the [Caktus Group](https://www.caktusgroup.com/) space. The event featured a MAJORITY of black participants.

### Black Python Devs Ice Cream Social

The conference kicked off the night before with the Black Python Devs Ice Cream Social at Durhams [_The Parlour_](https://theparlour.co/), our first official in-person event! 10 members attended and enjoyed a relaxed atmosphere for many folks to meet for the first time.

An ice cream parlor, with its universal appeal, served as a sweet alternative to an event in a bar, making it easy for attendees who do not drink to feel included. There were also diary-free options for those with sensitivities.

### Black Python Devs Open Space

The Black Python Devs Open Space was another engaging event, drawing nine Black Python developers along with two allies. The conversation was focused on what we could do with zero funding. Topics ranged from new events around contributing to open source and helping members find job opportunities. These types of events are essential in fostering a sense of community and belonging among underrepresented groups.

### Fun at the BoxCar Bar + Arcade

Many Black Python Devs members retreated to the [_Barcade_](https://theboxcarbar.com/durham/) (A combination of bar and arcade). The following morning was filled with many speakers telling each other, "That was SO MUCH FUN!".
