This year Black Python Devs were strongly represented with [41% of the folks running](https://blackpythondevs.github.io/2023-11-13-black-python-devs-represent-in-dsf-elections/) belonging to the community.

We're proud to share that [Sarah Abderemane](https://sarahabd.com/) was elected as one of the newest Django Software Foundation board members.

Congratulations Sarah! We look forward to your term as DSF Board Member and thank you for all you do for the Django and Black Python Developer community.
