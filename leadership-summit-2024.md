We are happy to announce the 2024 Black Python Devs Leadership Summit, held at the Caktus Group in Durham, North Carolina.

This year we're bringing presentations from folks all over the world to energize and inform our Black Python Devs leaders and guests.

## Interactive Talks

This is a summit focused on learning, and we learn by asking questions and connecting so we've asked three amazing speakers from inside Black Python Devs and outside of it to share knowledge with our leaders that can be taken back to their communities or used to make their efforts stronger.
