# Before You Get Started

## Code of Conduct

Black Python Devs follows the following [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/BlackPythonDevs/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) . The comfort and safety of Black Python Devs community members are our priority. Please do well to adhere to the Code of Conduct to participate in the Black Python Devs community.

## Issues & Pull Requests

### Creating an issue

Before **creating** an issue i.e for `features`/`bugs`/`improvements` please follow these steps:

1. Search existing issues before creating a new issue (look to see if the issue has already been created).
1. If it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible (please take note and select the correct issue type, for example `bug`, `documentation` or `feature`.
1. If you wish to work on the issue add this to the issue description.

### Working on an issue

Before working on an existing issue please follow these steps:

1. Comment asking for the issue to be assigned to you.
1. To best position yourself for issues assignment, we recommend that you:
   1. Confirm that you have read the CONTRIBUTING.md.
   1. Have a functional development environment (have built and are able to run the project).
   1. Convey your intended approach to solving the issue.
   1. Put each of these items in writing in one or more comments.
1. After the issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it.
1. In general, **only** start working on this issue (and open a Pull Request) when it has been assigned to you. Doing so will prevent confusion, duplicate work (some of which may go unaccepted given its duplicity), incidental stepping on toes, and the headache involved for maintainers and contributors alike as issue assignments collide and heads bump together.
1. Reference the issue in your Pull Request (for example `This PR fixes #123`), so that the corresponding issue is automatically closed upon merge of your Pull Request.

> Notes:
>
> - Check the `Assignees` box at the top of the page to see if the issue has been assigned to someone else before requesting this be assigned to you. If the issue has a current Assignee, but appears to be inactive, politely inquire with the current Assignee as to whether they are still working on a solution and/or if you might collaborate with them.
> - Only request to be assigned an issue if you know how to work on it.
> - If an issue is unclear, ask questions to get more clarity before asking to have the issue assigned to you; avoid asking "what do I do next? how do I fix this?" (see the item above this line)
> - An issue can be assigned to multiple people, if you all agree to collaborate on the issue (the Pull Request can contain commits from different collaborators)
> - Any issues that has no activity after 2 weeks will be unassigned and re-assigned to someone else.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

We welcome everyone to review Pull Requests. It is a great way to learn, network, and support each other.

### DOs

- Use inline comments to explain your suggestions
- Use inline suggestions to propose changes
- Exercise patience and empathy while offering critiques of the works of others.

### DON'Ts

- Do not repeat feedback, this creates more noise than value (check the existing conversation), use GitHub reactions if you agree/disagree with a comment
- Do not blindly approve Pull Requests to improve your GitHub contributors graph

## Discord Community

Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/XUc3tFqCT3) to discuss suggested new features, possible bugs, enhancement in user experience, and any other aspects of the site. The comment section of each issue is our preferred method of communication as it retains conversations history for future contributors wanting to gain insights/updates on the topic in question, you can, however, inquire in the #community-discussion channel in the Black Python Devs Discord workspace.

# Accessibility

Accessibility (A11y) using the **FastPass** tests for A11y and the [Accessibility Insights for Web
][1] browser extension.

## 1: Reproduce the Tests

First, reproduce the **FastPass** tests for A11y using the [Accessibility Insights for Web
][1] browser extension. This extension is designed to help you identify and fix accessibility issues on your website.

## 2: Capture the issues

If the Accessibility Insights for Web extension identifies any issues, capture a screenshot of the issues on the [BPDevs](https://BlackPythonDevs.github.io/) website. You can do this by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> on your keyboard.

## 3: Make the Necessary Changes

Next, make the necessary changes to fix the identified issues. This might involve modifying the CSS of the website.

## 4: Test the Changes

After making the changes, run the **FastPass** test again and capture a screenshot showing no accessibility issues. This will serve as proof that the issues have been successfully resolved.

## 5: Check and Pass Other Tests

Finally, check and pass other tests, such as the rules with `pre-commit`. This ensures that your changes are in line with the existing codebase and do not introduce any new issues.

# Translations

We welcome translations for the Black Python Devs website in all languages! Here's how you can contribute:

The language code being used should be in the format [<ISO 639-1>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

1. [**Fork the repository**](#2-fork-the-code): Make a copy of this project on your account.

2. **Create a new branch**: Make a new branch for your translation work to keep it separate from the main project: e.g. `es` .

3. **Translate**: Translate all the content in your preferred language. Please ensure that the translation is accurate and professional.

   - Copy `_data/locales/en.yml` to your target language file e.g. `_data/locales/es.yml` and translate all the strings.

   - Create a new directory in `_articles/` for your language e.g. `_articles/es/`, copy each guide from `_articles/` into that folder and translate the content in each guide.

   - Copy `index.html` to your target language index file e.g. [`_articles/es/index.html`](https://github.com/BlackPythonDevs/blackpythondevs.github.io/blob/HEAD/_articles/es/index.html) and update the `lang:` and add the `permalink:` fields. Example: `lang: es` and `permalink: /es/`.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: You may send a pull request before all steps above are complete: e.g., you may want to ask for help with translations, or getting tests to pass. However, your pull request will not be merged until all steps above are complete.

Our maintainers will review your pull request and merge it if everything is in order. We appreciate your contribution to making Black Python Devs accessible to more people around the world!
